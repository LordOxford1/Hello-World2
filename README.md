# Hello-World2
so  hello, hello.
Ok pencil icon on RHS at top lets me come back and edit
so now I should entor BransonSpace or keep up with BransonsPace..    it's 

20-11-019 @18:05 and I've watched a CNN "special loop" of related Branson videos ... glad to see you have a more realistic stratolaunch -  actually. even more can be achieved with a few specialised jets.

Shackleton Hotel (www.ShackletonHotel.com )needs an initial 50kg payload landed (on the moon) by a 50Kg ship with 150Kg of propellant used to achieve it.
we land at a precise spot. then deploy our 50Kg cargo as movable heat shield, solar power and communications arrays.  the site is unique in ALWAYS being in sunlight, not just in summar, like the North pole of Earth, but all day, all the time, all seasons ... the sun takes 28 days to go around the horizon which is on the ecliptic  ... our selected site is only a little bit higher than the surrounding "horizon" - 
we are on the ridgetop of Shackleton Crater and there may be several lesser cratwers nearby  in some of these, the subn never ever shines in and these zones are very cold, and now known to carry water ice or snow at very low temperature.  we hope there is dry ice (carbon dioxide) in there too, delivered the same way by millions of tiny meteorite fragments over billions of years 
our "rovers" are tiny and are hurled rather than wheeled.  they are on a tether which can propel them a considerable distance before being towec back, or catapulted again, a 500 metre distant throw on the moon is like a 100m throw on Earth.

18:30  first save

(/centre?)                              The tail of two tethers 

should be "a seperate thought" associated with the next small ship arrival

we expect to be able to obtain 100 litres in 100 hours.  Perhaps slower, perhaps quicker….

Meanwhile with a tiny “drag line crane” we  gather dusty regolith nearby, ready to be heated – we expect a lot of aluminium oxide – but other materials may make suitable building amalgams 

we radially print and brace an enclosure around our tiny lander …
 perhaps as we dismantle and recycle it or dig in 
Or select a small crater to store our ice and snow in until better tankage can be made

a concentrating solar collector is verty easy to build and track,, and a steam turbine plant can provide the larger power supply needed to produce aluminium. In the moons vacuum pipes and other structures can be made of aluminium by plasma deposit … but some ceramics may be made too  
it’s all made in “tiny town” at perhaps 1Kg per 24 hours. there are 28 days x 24hrs = 672 hours per lunar day.

there are many SMALL "telechir robots" in our 50Kg cargo - we'd like to keep them under 5kg, but if they get to be 10Kg we only have 3 or 4. limiting how much Supercord we can carry. we want at least 1Km of 20Kg strength.

our first explorer (above) is catapulted (on a tether) into crater where we hope to find water. its 3 inertial gyros and/or the spooling out tether drag get it to land right side up - after laying an anchor it may then be hauled back up to the lander - or take several further hops to lay a second anchor or discover some snow (or other interesting regolith to gather, before being hauled back in on a sledge.
the "lander locals" to collect regolith do similar small local hops

our other telechir rocbots  do setup and maintenance tasks on our first lander - the first shield, PV array and antennae ... the next thing to produce is a concentrating parabolic reflector array to heat gathered spoils (prepared) in a crucible

the load gathered by each of these "mini drag lines" is less than 1/2 to 1Kg per trip - but several work different fields.  note that we are talking in Kg MASS collected, not weight, which in lunar gravity "weight" is abouut 1/5 of that mass

Experiments with gathered mass involve sorting dust from pebbles, weighing and then furnacing (and re-weighing to detect volatiles released) and sorting into piles to assess material type and usefulness.  Bauxite contains aluminium oxide - our main target from the local diggers. surface material is more likely to be hot and fine dust

our long range explorer finds snow or ice, but may not be able to pick this deep frozen stuff. if it is able to it takes it to none solar illuminated area for transfer to a sealed container for melting or steaming seperation the excavation area will become a specialised extraction space
