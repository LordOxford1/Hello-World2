# Hello-World2
so  hello, hello.
Ok pencil icon on RHS at top lets me come back and edit
so now I should entor BransonSpace or keep up with BransonsPace..    it's 20-11-019 @18:05 and I've watched a CNN "special loop" of related Branson videos ... glad to see you have a more realistic stratolaunch -  actually. even more can be achieved with a few specialised jets.

Shackleton Hotel (www.ShackletonHotel.com )needs an initial 50kg payload landed (on the moon) by a 50Kg ship with 150Kg of propellant used to achieve it.
we land at a precise spot. then deploy our 50Kg cargo as movable heat shield, solar power and communications arrays.  the site is unique in ALWAYS being in sunlight, not just in summar, like the North pole of Earth, but all day, all the time, all seasons ... the sun takes 28 days to go around the horizon which is on the ecliptic  ... our selected site is only a little bit higher than the surrounding "horizon" - 
we are on the ridgetop of Shackleton Crater and there may be several lesser cratwers nearby  in some of these, the subn never ever shines in and these zones are very cold, and now known to carry water ice or snow at very low temperature.  we hope there is dry ice (carbon dioxide) in there too, delivered the same way by millions of tiny meteorite fragments over billions of years 
our "rovers" are tiny and are hurled rather than wheeled.  they are on a tether which can propel them a considerable distance before being towec back, or catapulted again, a 500 metre distant throw on the moon is like a 100m throw on Earth.

18:30  first save

(/centre?)                              The tail of two tethers 
should be a seperate thought associated with the next small ship arrival

we expect to be able to obtain 100 litres in 100 hours.  Perhaps slower, perhaps quicker….

Meanwhile with a tiny “drag line crane” we  gather dusty regolith nearby, ready to be heated – we expect a lot of aluminium oxide – but other materials may make suitable building amalgams 

we radially print and brace an enclosure around our tiny lander …
 perhaps as we dismantle and recycle it or dig in 
Or select a small crater to store our ice and snow in until better tankage can be made

a concentrating solar collector is verty easy to build and track,, and a steam turbine plant can provide the larger power supply needed to produce aluminium. In the moons vacuum pipes and other structures can be made of aluminium by plasma deposit … but some ceramics may be made too  
it’s all made in “tiny town” at perhaps 1Kg per 24 hours. there are 28 days x 24hrs = 672 hours per lunar day.
